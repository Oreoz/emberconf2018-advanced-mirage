# EmberConf 2018 Training â€“Â Advanced Mirage

Hi there!

We're super excited that you're attending our **Advanced Mirage** training at EmberConf on Monday. ðŸ˜€

Follow the steps below to make sure your computer is set up with our training app.

Conference WiFi isn't super reliable, so we recommend doing the setup ahead of time at home or work.

We'll ask that you `git pull` one more time the morning of the training to get the latest code â€“Â but the core node modules shouldn't change.

# Setup

> If you have any trouble with these steps, shoot us an email at [info@embermap.com](mailto:info@embermap.com).

## Node.js

We're using Node.js 8.9.4, which is the current LTS version.

## App

1. Open terminal

3. Move into the directory: `cd emberconf2018-advanced-mirage`
